# Jupyter

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (formerly IPython Notebook) is set of tools for scientific research, engineering calculation, data extraction and visualization. Starting from IPython toolchain now it grow up to support a wide area of useful libraries and power languages.

GitHub have internal [support](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3) for rendering of Jupyter notebooks from commited `.ipynb` files.
