# Jupyter

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (formerly IPython Notebook) is set of tools for scientific research, engineering calculation, data extraction and visualization. Starting from IPython toolchain now it grow up to support a wide area of useful libraries and power languages (see a list of [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)).

GitHub have internal [support](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3) for rendering of Jupyter notebooks from commited `.ipynb` files.

[Try](https://try.jupyter.org/) Jupyter in your browser.
